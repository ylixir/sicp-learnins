# sicp-learnins

just a place to track my solutions as i work my way through sicp

no nix env or anything for this one, just using Dr Racket which apparently is the bees knees.

https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/Installation.html

*update*
switched to pure vim, sun a repl with
```sh
raco pkg install sicp
racket -I sicp
```
